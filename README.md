- **Too Slow**  
  _Scaling in Too Slow isn't accurate, and there are missing but not very noticable BG elements_
- **Fatality**  
  _Script fails to load when opening the song at random times, press F5 to reload the script and it will work._
- **Personel (Serious)**  
  _Rank percentage will be 75% (G) no matter if you 100% "Sick!" the song or not._
- **Triple Trouble**  
  _Currently uses old stage assets. (I found this out after I'd already finished the song, Lol.)_

> ‚öôÔ∏è _Note: All songs still need proper transitions._

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Restored Asset Notice

Some elements in this mod are taken from the **RESTORED** version of the Versus Sonic.exe mod (by Merphi and his team).  
This means **they were not made by the EXE team** and could pose a takedown risk.  
If necessary, I may be required to remove the following songs and/or their assets:

- **Personel (Serious)**
- **More** _(unfinished)_
